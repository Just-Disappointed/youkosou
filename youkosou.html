		<h1><br><br> WELCOME TO POSTMORTEM ECONOMICS </h1>
		
		<p class = "Introduction">
		Hello, Brethren. <br> <br>
		Welcome to my blog: Postmortem Economics. <br> <br>
		
		
		You may call me Tabulady because data in tabular format is all I see when I close my eyes.<br> <br>
		
		This blog is where I want to keep all the ideas I have brewing and all 
		the code I don't want to forget and; perhaps, 
		even meet people who share my academic interests.<br> <br>
		
		I will write a lot about Malawian macroeconomics for two reasons.

		
		First of all, there is a lot research potential in 
		the Malawian economy. And we must not forget the 
		eternal and most obvious question that no one can 
		actually fully answer.
		<br> <br>
		</p>

		<p class = "reason1">
		<br> <br>
		But, outside of this, there are many interesting questions to ask about the economy such as:
			<ul>
				<li>how does policymaking manifest in an environment of state fragility?</li>
				<li>how effective is monetary policy in a low income country?</li>
				<li>what does financial development look like in a country with shallow capital markets?</li>
				<li>what does economic development look like in countries with large primary sectors?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	
		<p class = "reason2">
		Secondly, I am from Malawi and I am an economist. <br> <br>
		
		Please note that there will also be articles about other countries and topics, all within the realm
		of economics, because I am curious about a great many things and I resist specialization.
		
		<a
		Unless its profitable for me to do so
		</a>
		</P>
	
		<p class = "conclusion">
		Now, keep in mind that: 
			<li>All the articles will be written with my playful irreverent voice.</li>
			<li>Some of them will have companion pieces written in a proper academic format.</li>
			<li>All of them will have citations because we are professionals here.</li><br> <br>

		Now, welcome and join me on this educational journey!
